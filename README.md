🚀𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐲 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭: 𝐆𝐏𝐓-𝟑 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞🚀

I’ve built a single-page website using 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐭.𝐣𝐬 and 𝐂𝐒𝐒 to provide an easy-to-understand and smooth experience for users to learn about GPT-3. This website is fully responsive, meaning it looks great on any device—whether it’s your phone, tablet, or computer. 📱💻

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:

𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧: The website automatically adjusts to fit all screen sizes, ensuring the best experience on any device.

𝐄𝐚𝐬𝐲 𝐍𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The navigation bar includes 5 main links—Home, What is GPT-3?, Case Studies, OpenAI, and Library—which smoothly scroll to the corresponding sections on the same page, along with Sign Up and Sign In options.

𝐌𝐨𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐞-𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐲: Used React’s 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 hook to ensure that the navigation is easy to use on mobile devices.

𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐔𝐈: The design uses gradients and images to create a clean, visually appealing look.

𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:

𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐭.𝐣𝐬 – for building interactive components

𝐂𝐒𝐒 – for designing a smooth, responsive layout
